        "Social media platforms like Twitter generate a vast number of posts every second, expressing a wide range of sentiments. These messages can be classified as positive, negative, or neutral. Automating sentiment classification through machine learning and deep learning models enables businesses to analyze social media trends efficiently, saving time and reducing reliance on manual efforts.\n",

        "This project focuses on analyzing real-time Twitter data and categorizing tweets based on sentiment. By leveraging deep neural networks and hyperparameter optimization, we aim to enhance the accuracy of sentiment predictions. The insights obtained from these models can provide valuable business intelligence for decision-making.\n",
